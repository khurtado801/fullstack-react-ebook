### Running the app

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

Follow the instructions for your platform [here](https://github.com/npm/npm).

2. Install all dependencies:

````
npm install
````

3. Boot the HTTP server

````
npm run server
````

The server is now running at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000)


Framwork for developing a React app from scratch:

!. Break the app into components
2. Build a static version of the app
3. Determine what should be stateful
4. Determine in which component each piece of state should live
5. Hard-code initial states
6. Add inverse data flow
7. Add server communication
